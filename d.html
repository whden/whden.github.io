It is said that many policies will be implemented starting in May as the Yoon Seok-yeol administration took office this time .  


 

It is divided into six areas: common benefits, youth policy, childbirth and childcare policy, small business owners, the elderly, and low-income policy.

 

Today, let's take a closer look at the policy in the Common Benefit sector. 

 

 

■ Subway commuter pass 
Subway commuter pass is   a system that offers up to 20-30%  discount if used well .


 

It is known as a very useful system for those commuting to and from large cities.

 

However , it has been pointed out that the disadvantage is that there is no transfer when taking the bus, so there are benefits only to those who live near the station   .


 

It is said that the next government will expand the range of subway commuter pass specifications so that they can be used when transferring to buses   .

 

 

■  Expand health insurance for diabetic patients
The second is to expand the coverage of continuous blood glucose meter health insurance to diabetic patients  .


 

From now on, it is said that the health insurance will support continuous blood glucose meters for gestational adult diabetic patients .

 

As a result , the burden of blood sugar management costs is greatly reduced  .

 

 

■  Year-end tax settlement relief
The third is year-end tax settlement. It is said to ease the tax burden .

 

First of all , the personal deduction amount is   raised to 2 million won .  It is said that the dependency requirement will  be relaxed until the age of 25 .


 

  It is said to increase benefits such as a 50%  increase in the credit card use deduction limit .

 

Personally, I think it would be nice to add more income deductions for small business owners .

 

 

■  Expansion of electric vehicle gas stations
Fourth, it is said to make it possible to charge electric vehicles at gas stations .


 

 It is said that the related regulations will be eased so that electric vehicle total stations are also installed in gas stations and lpg charging stations  .

 

■  Electric vehicle charging fee freeze
Fifth, the electric vehicle charging rate   will be frozen for 5 years .


 

Electric vehicle charging rates have risen considerably .  Taking this into account, it is said  that the amount will be frozen for 5 years .

 

■  Unification of social standards by age

 

The sixth is to unify legal and social standards by age. In fact, if we applied age, we would be a year or two younger . 

 

■  Sports facility income deduction possible
The next seventh is that the use of indoor sports facilities will be deducted from income  .


 

Many people use the gym ,  Pilates ,  yoga, and other sports facilities of the times .

 

This amount is also tax deductible .  This seems like a really good policy .

 

■  Support for cervical cancer vaccination costs
Eighth , it  is said that the cost of cervical cancer vaccination will be subsidized  .


 

It is known that the cervical cancer vaccination is not only given to women but also men to prevent transmission .

 

However  , it was not easy to get vaccinated because the cost for one dose is around 200,000 won, and   it is about 500,000 to 600,000 won because you have to get 3 doses .  It is said that this cost will also be supported in the future .

 

■  TOEIC, Korean history accreditation period extended
The ninth is that the period of recognition of official scores such as TOEIC  and Korean history will be extended.

 

The period of official scores such as TOEIC and Korean History Proficiency Test is  2 years .  They say it will cost you up to  5 years .


 

It is said that once it is expanded to the front of public sector recruitment and other companies apply it, incentives will be given   .

 

I really hope that this will be realized and reduce the psychological burden and cost burden of job seekers .
